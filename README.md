# Archiving Personal Web Pages Hosted by Binghamton University
I archive all webpages hosted at Binghamton University. I first download a copy of each web page. I then compare current pages with stored pages to determine change. When change is found, I update my website with the new content.

## Bingweb
Binghamton Univeristy hosts student and faculty web pages at no cost. More can be read at http://harvey2.cc.binghamton.edu/, http://harvey.cc.binghamton.edu/, and http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/. A user's web page can be accessed at bingweb.binghamton.edu/~username, harvey.binghamton.edu/~username, and harvey.cc.binghamton.edu/~username.
